# Learning Rust

A guide to learning Rust

## Package finders

### Blessed.rs

[Blessed.rs](https://blessed.rs/crates)

> An unofficial guide to the Rust ecosystem.

Helps you find crates to complement the minimal approach Rust has to the "batteries included" philosophy.

<!-- Good place to start as it appears to contain a smaller selection of more established crates. -->

### Lib.rs

(https://lib.rs/)

> Index of Rust libraries and applications. Lightweight, opinionated, curated, unofficial alternative to crates.io.

With own sorting algorithm, and a search function.
