# Learning Rust

A guide to learning Rust

## Books

#### The Rust Programming Language

https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/#the-rust-programming-language

#### The Embedded Rust Book

An introductory book about using the Rust Programming Language on "Bare Metal" embedded systems, such as Microcontrollers.

https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/

## Package finders

#### Blessed.rs

https://blessed.rs/crates

> An unofficial guide to the Rust ecosystem.

Helps you find crates to complement the minimal approach Rust has to the "batteries included" philosophy.

<!-- Good place to start as it appears to contain a smaller selection of more established crates. -->

#### Lib.rs

https://lib.rs/

> Index of Rust libraries and applications. Lightweight, opinionated, curated, unofficial alternative to crates.io.

With own sorting algorithm, and a search function.

## Probably useful crates
